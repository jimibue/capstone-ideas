## Visual Translator

#### Overview

Use your camera to scan text in a foreign language, and have it translated to another language of choice.

#### MVP

* Users can use their phone camera to take a picture / scan text
* Text in the image will be processed for translation
* The langage of the initial text will be automatically detected
* Users can choose in which language to translate the final result

#### Stretch Goals

* Instead of automatic detection of the initial text, users have the option to manually set the initial language for better translation results
* Ability to set a "default" language that all text will be translated to
* Variety of languages supported by the app
* "Immediate translation": translation is overlayed on camera
* Audio component to speak the initial or translated text

#### Technical Challenges

* Image processing / text detection
* Accurate real-time translations
* Mobile-friendly
